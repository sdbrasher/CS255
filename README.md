- **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**

The DriverPass company, owned by Liam, notices a high incidence of new drivers failing their first driving test. Their company provides training services to new drivers in order to help their chances at passing their test. They want us to design an online system that will allow customers to regsiter for classes and view instructor feedback, as well as administrative functions like blocking or resetting user accounts or viewing different activity reports.

- **What did you do particularly well?**

I believe I did a good job identifying the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the system.

- **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I believe I would impove the activity diagrams in the system design document. I would like to outline processes in more detail and include more processes. I am wary of leaving out a necessary step in a process by assuming it will be covered in a yet-unmade design.

- **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

We were supplied interview notes that gave a decent amount of detail regarding what the owner, Liam, expected out of the system. Asking as many clarifying questions as possible is a good idea, but we did not have the luxury of additional contact with the company. It is important to correctly identify and implement the user's needs as soon as possible. Designing a system that does not consider the user's needs is essentially wasted effort, as the user's needs drives our business.

- **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

I would try and start implementing a process and object model of the system. We should focus on continously refining our models as we get new information about the user's needs.
